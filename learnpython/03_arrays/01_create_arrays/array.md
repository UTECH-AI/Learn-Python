# Arrays
- We use [] to create lists in python
- We can store multiple values in a list such as booleans, string ,numbers....
- To acces the value of the array we use it's index. 
- for example 

```py
names= ["JJ","Kevin","Kate"] 
print(names) # ["JJ","Kevin","Kate"]
```


```py
names= ["JJ","Kevin","Kate"] 
print(names[0]) #"JJ"
```
- to grab multiple elements in an arry we cna spefcify them by using an index and a colon

```py
names= ["JJ","Kevin","Kate"] 
print(names[1:]) #"Kevin","Kate"
```

- we can also grab elemensts in a range 
- nb this does not print the last value of the range

```py
names= ["JJ","Kevin","Kate","Liz", "Charles"] 
print(names[1:3]) #"Kevin","Kate"
```
