- The word "and" is reserved for Boolean or logical operations. When implying this keyword, it means that an operation will be applied only when both conditions are true.

- The word "or" is also reserved for Boolean or logical operations. When implying this keyword, it means that an operation will be applied even when one of the conditions stands true.

- The word "not"is also reserved for Boolean or logical operations. When implying this keyword, it means that an operation will be applied when the given conditional expression is not satisfied. When using not wrap the variable in ()
